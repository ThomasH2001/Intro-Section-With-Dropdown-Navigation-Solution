## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS media queries
- CSS pseudo-elements
- CSS pseudo-classes
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make some, but not all, of the screen dimmed and unclickable using psuedo-elements and the z-index. I also learned how to make a CSS selector not apply to all child elements of the selected element by using the pseudo-classes :not and :has.

### Continued development

I want to improve my skills so I can create more advanced layouts and menus. I also want to learn more about CSS pseudo-classes.

### Useful resources

- [z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index)

## Acknowledgments

[This Stack Overflow answer by Zach Saucier](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22270199) helped me figure out how to not have the hover state activated on the entire dropdown menu, but instead only activated on the text and pictures.
